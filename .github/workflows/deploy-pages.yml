# NOTE: Automatic deployment is disabled. The conformance.ipfs.tech web dashboard
# was discontinued in 2023 when Protocol Labs ran out of time before nucleation.
# The workflow can still be triggered manually via workflow_dispatch if needed
# for testing purposes. The scheduled hourly runs and push triggers (lines 7-11)
# are commented out to prevent automatic deployments.
